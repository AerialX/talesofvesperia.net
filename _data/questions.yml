      No. Any console of any region is able to play the game in English.
- name: What do I need for this patch?
  content: |
      <ul>
      <li>A PS3 that can run homebrew. As of early 2018, this includes all Fat models as well as all regular Slim models manufactured before a certain date. As of writing, all firmware versions work, but versions after 4.82 may no longer work.</li>
      <li>A retail copy of Tales of Vesperia for the PS3.</li>
      <li>A PC to run the patching tool.</li>
      <li>The patching tool itself.</li>
      </ul>
- name: How do I run homebrew on my PS3?

      We're not the right place for that information. As far as I know, <a href="http://www.ps3hax.net/">PS3Hax</a> is the place to go to for news and information on installing and running homebrew on PS3s.
- name: My PS3 is unable to run homebrew, or I'm not willing to run homebrew on my console. What can I do instead?
  content: |
      We recommend that you use the <a href="http://hyouta.com/vesperia/">Online Translation Guide</a> instead.
- name: Where can I get a copy of the game?
  content: |
      Check the links in the left sidebar.
- name: New Game+ doesn't show or unlock with the patch, what's wrong?
  content: |
      You used the patched TROPHY.TRP in an incompatible environment. If you can't make the console actually accept the modified trophy file, keep or restore the original.
- name: The text does not fit right on screen. What's wrong?

      If your font looks like in the latter screenshot, you have failed to patch your EBOOT.BIN. Please ensure it is actually patched before you make any bug reports!

- name: Wait, what happened to R3volution?

      It didn't work out, for both time and technical reasons. It's unfortunate, but it wasn't worth holding up the patch even longer for a tool that may or may not ever exist.
